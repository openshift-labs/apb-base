# apb-base
Base image for APBs developed for OpenShift Labs

This image adds to [ansibleplaybookbundle/apb-base](https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/apb-base) missing python libraries needed for the APBs developed for OpenShift labs


Version 1.3 maps to OpenShift 3.11, although it should also work on previous releases
Version 1.2 maps to OpenShift 3.10, although it also works on 3.11

Most APBs will be developed using 1.2 release, as this one is fully tested, and gradually will move to 1.3
